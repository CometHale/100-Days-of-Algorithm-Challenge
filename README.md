# I joined the #100DaysOfAlgorithm Challenge. 

##Logs 

### Day 0: January 20, 2017 
1) **1_HackerRank_SolveMeFirst.cpp:** Simple program that prints the sum of two integers entered via stdin.

2) **2_HackerRank_SimpleArraySum.cpp:** Simple program that prints the sum of the elements in an array whose elements are entered via stdin.

3) **3_HackerRank_CompareTheTriplets.cpp** Simple program that compares two 3-element vectors.

4) **4_HackerRank_30Days_Day0.cpp** First day in the 30 Days of Code challenge on HackerRank. Prints 'Hello World.' and a string input by a user.

### Day 1: January 21, 2017 
1) **5_HackerRank_30Days_Day1.cpp:** Second day in the 30 Days of Code challenge on HackerRank. Takes various types of input from stdin (integer, double, string), and adds or contatenates that input to data of like data types before printing the results to stdout.

### Day 2: January 22, 2017

1) **6_HackerRank_30Days_Day2.cpp:** Third day in the 30 Days of Code challenge on HackerRank. Calculates the total cost of a meal based a user-input meal cost, tip percent and tax percent.

2) **7_HackerRank_AVeryBigSum.py:** Similar to Simple Array Sum, but dealing with massive integers instead.Done in python due to some odd errors with the C++ editor on HackerRank.

3)**8_HackerRank_DiagonalDifference.cpp:** Calculates the absolute difference between the diagonal sums of a square matrix. 

### Day 3: January 23,2017

1) **9_HackerRank_30Days_Day3.cpp:** Some practice with conditional statements.

2)**10_HackerRank_PlusMinus.cpp** Some practice with precision in regards to floating point numbers.

### Day 4: January 24,2017

1) **11_HackerRank_30Days_Day4.cpp** Some practice with OOP via the HackerRank 30 Days of Code Challenge.

### Day 5: January 25,2017

1) **12_HackerRank_30Days_Day5.cpp** Some practice with loops and multiplication.

### Day 6: January 26,2017

1) **14_HackerRank_30Days_Day6.cpp** Prints out the even and odd placed characters of a user-specified number of user-input strings.

### Day 7: January 27,2017

1) **15_HackerRank_30Days_Day7.cpp** Prints out the elements of an array backwards and separated by spaces on a single line.
